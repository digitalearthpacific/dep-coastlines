# Digital Earth Pacific Coastlines

This is a work-in-progress adaptation of [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-coastlines) and [Digital Earth
Africa
Coastlines](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-coastlines) products
for the Pacific nations. Please refer to the following for a description of the
algorithms on which we based this work:

> Bishop-Taylor, R., Nanson, R., Sagar, S., Lymburner, L. (2021). Mapping
> Australia's dynamic coastline at mean sea level using three decades of Landsat
> imagery. _Remote Sensing of Environment_, 267, 112734. Available:
> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112734

> Bishop-Taylor, R., Sagar, S., Lymburner, L., Alam, I., Sixsmith, J. (2019). Sub-pixel waterline extraction: characterising accuracy and sensitivity to indices and spectra. _Remote Sensing_, 11 (24):2984. Available: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11242984

We have adapted the algorithms where necessary to account for differences in the
study area and the available input datasets, as well as for performance. A full
writeup is in process.

The product is visible on the [Digital Earth Pacific](https://digitalearthpacific.org) [map interface](https://maps.digitalearthpacific.org).
